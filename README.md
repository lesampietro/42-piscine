École 42 is a NGO focused on making the technology field more diverse by also giving minorities the opportunity to graduate in software engineering.
The school's methodology is based in pair-programming and it's recognized worldwide as one of the most innovative and ethical places to study.
I was given the chance to dive into 42's "piscine", which is a 26-day long imersive process that aims to select students for the graduation program.
